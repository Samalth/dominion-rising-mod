```

/nation info
# Output: Nation: Kingdom of Avalon | Leader: You | Members: 3 | Balance: 0.00

/nation disband
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Leadership Rules
- **Leaders cannot leave** their nation using `/nation leave`
- **Only leaders can disband** their nation using `/nation disband`
- Disbanding removes ALL members and permanently deletes the nation

### Nation Names
- Must be **1-32 characters long**
- Must be **unique** (case-insensitive)
- Spaces and special characters are allowed

### Current Limitations
- **No persistence**: Nations are stored in memory and reset on server restart
- **No economy integration**: Balance tracking is implemented but not connected to economy systems
- **No GUI**: All interactions are command-based
- **No warfare system**: Combat mechanics not yet implemented

## üîß For Server Administrators

### Commands in Console
All player commands work from the server console, but require a player context. Use command blocks or other plugins to manage nations programmatically.

### Performance
- Thread-safe implementation using ConcurrentHashMap
- Minimal memory footprint
- No database dependencies
- Suitable for large multiplayer servers
